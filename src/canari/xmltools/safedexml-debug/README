Copy this folder into path and rename it to safedexml or if you have installed
safedexml from pip, overwrite the dist-packages path
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/safedexml/ with the content.

This will generate some debug output.

It is advised to only copy one of the files at a time (e.g., only __init__.py or
only fields.py) as their output will mingle and it will be near to impossible to
tell them apart.  Yest the output is wery simple and could probably have been
made smarter...

Currently the output of __init__.py is the 'best', in the sense that it tries to
nest the output and indent it so, it is easier to follow function calls, and the
'parsing logic' within the parse() function.
